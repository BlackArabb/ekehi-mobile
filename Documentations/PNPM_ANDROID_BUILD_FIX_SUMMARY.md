# PNPM Android Build Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Missing `@react-native/assets-registry` module during Android release build
2. Missing `babel-preset-expo` module during Android release build

## Root Cause
PNPM-specific issue where dependencies that are transitively included in pnpm-lock.yaml still need to be explicitly declared in package.json to be available during the build process.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added @react-native/assets-registry to dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native/assets-registry": "0.74.87",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

### 2. Added babel-preset-expo to devDependencies
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-expo": "~11.0.0",
    // ... other devDependencies
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
1. package.json - Added the missing dependencies
2. PNPM_ANDROID_BUILD_FIX.md - Documentation of the fixes

## Verification Steps
1. Run `pnpm install` to install the newly added dependencies
2. Run `cd android && gradlew assembleRelease` to build the Android release APK

## Expected Outcome
The Android release build should now complete successfully without the "Cannot find module" errors.

## Additional Notes
This is a common issue with pnpm and React Native/Expo projects. All required packages must be explicitly declared in package.json dependencies, even if they appear in pnpm-lock.yaml, to prevent Metro bundler errors during Android release builds.
