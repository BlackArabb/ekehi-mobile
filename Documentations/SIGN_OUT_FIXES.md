# Sign Out Fixes

This document explains the issues that were identified and fixed in the sign out functionality.

## Issues Identified

1. **Platform-Specific Behavior**: The sign out functionality worked on mobile but not on web browsers
2. **State Management**: Web browsers required a full page reload to properly clear authentication state
3. **Navigation Issues**: Router-based navigation on web didn't always properly redirect to the auth screen

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Platform-Specific Sign Out Handling
- Added platform detection to handle sign out differently on web vs mobile
- Web platforms now use `window.location.href` for direct navigation
- Mobile platforms continue to use router-based navigation

### 2. Web-Specific State Clearing
- Added forced page reload for web platforms to ensure clean state
- Implemented direct URL redirection for web sign out
- Added error handling that redirects to auth page even on failure

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added fallback navigation for both platforms
- Enhanced error messages with platform-specific guidance
- Implemented timeout-based verification for sign out completion

## Technical Details

### AuthContext.tsx Changes
- Added platform detection using `Platform.OS === 'web'`
- Implemented `window.location.href` for web navigation
- Added forced page reload with timeout for web platforms
- Enhanced error handling with web-specific fallbacks

### ProfilePage.tsx Changes
- Added platform-specific sign out logic
- Implemented direct URL redirection for web (`window.location.href`)
- Maintained router-based navigation for mobile platforms
- Added import for `Platform` from `react-native`

## Testing

The sign out functionality has been tested on:
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Both successful and error scenarios

## Files Modified

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core sign out logic with platform-specific handling
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Sign out UI with platform-specific navigation
- `SIGN_OUT_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## Configuration Requirements

No additional configuration is required. The fix uses existing platform detection capabilities in React Native.
