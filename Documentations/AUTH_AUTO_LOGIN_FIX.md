# Authentication Auto-Login Fix

## Issue
The authentication system was continuously attempting to log in users even when signup information was incorrect. This was caused by the auto-login mechanism that detected auto-filled credentials but didn't properly handle error states.

## Root Cause
The auto-login `useEffect` hook in [app/auth.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/app/auth.tsx) was triggering login attempts whenever email and password fields were populated, without checking if previous signup attempts had failed. This created an infinite loop where failed signup attempts would trigger new login attempts.

## Solution
Added a new state variable `signupErrorOccurred` to track when signup errors occur and prevent auto-login attempts in those cases.

### Changes Made

1. **Added new state variable**:
   ```typescript
   const [signupErrorOccurred, setSignupErrorOccurred] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Modified the auto-login useEffect hook** to check the new state:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Check if both email and password are filled (likely from auto-fill)
     // Only attempt auto-login if we haven't had a signup error
     if (email && password && !autoFilled && !autoLoginAttempted && !isLoading && !signupErrorOccurred) {
       // Only trigger auto-login if we have valid credentials
       if (validateEmail(email) && password.length >= 6) {
         setAutoFilled(true);
         setAutoLoginAttempted(true);
         // Small delay to ensure fields are properly populated
         setTimeout(() => {
           handleEmailAuth();
         }, 300);
       }
     }
   }, [email, password, autoFilled, autoLoginAttempted, isLoading, signupErrorOccurred]);
   ```

3. **Reset the error state** when switching between sign up and sign in modes:
   ```typescript
   onPress={() => {
     setIsSignUp(!isSignUp);
     // Clear errors when switching modes
     setEmailError('');
     setPasswordError('');
     setNameError('');
     // Reset signup error state when switching modes
     setSignupErrorOccurred(false);
   }}
   ```

4. **Set the error state** when signup fails:
   ```typescript
   // Set signup error state if this was a signup attempt
   if (isSignUp) {
     setSignupErrorOccurred(true);
   }
   ```

5. **Reset the error state** on successful signup:
   ```typescript
   // Reset error state on successful signup
   setSignupErrorOccurred(false);
   ```

## Testing
The fix has been tested to ensure:
1. Auto-login still works correctly for valid auto-filled credentials
2. Failed signup attempts prevent further auto-login attempts
3. Switching between sign up and sign in modes resets the error state
4. Successful signup resets the error state
