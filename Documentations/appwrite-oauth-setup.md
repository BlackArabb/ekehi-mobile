# Appwrite OAuth Configuration Guide

To fix the "Invalid success param: invalid URI" error, you need to properly configure OAuth redirect URIs in your Appwrite project.

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. Access Appwrite Console
1. Log in to your Appwrite Console
2. Select your project (Project ID: 68c2dd6e002112935ed2)

### 2. Navigate to OAuth Settings
1. Go to **Auth** section in the left sidebar
2. Click on **Settings** tab

### 3. Add Web Platform for Hosted OAuth
1. Scroll down to **Platforms** section
2. Click **Add Platform** button
3. Select **Web** platform type
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: Ekehi OAuth
   - **Hostname**: ekehi-oauth.netlify.app
5. Click **Register** to add the platform

### 4. Configure Google OAuth (If not already done)
1. In the same **Auth** section, click on **Google** under OAuth providers
2. Make sure it's enabled
3. Enter your Google OAuth Client credentials:
   - **Client ID**: 842046112756-rk2jcdf9l7f4cbh136u4tm591qmtl6bq.apps.googleusercontent.com
   - **Client Secret**: [Your Google OAuth Client Secret]
4. Click **Update** to save

### 5. Verify Redirect URLs
After adding the platform, verify that the following redirect URLs are now valid:
- Success URL: `https://ekehi-oauth.netlify.app/oauth/return`
- Failure URL: `https://ekehi-oauth.netlify.app/auth`

## How the Hosted OAuth System Works

1. User taps "Continue with Google" in the mobile app
2. App opens browser with Appwrite OAuth URL
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Appwrite redirects to your hosted OAuth system at `https://ekehi-oauth.netlify.app/oauth/return`
5. Hosted system processes the authentication and displays success/failure page
6. User returns to the mobile app manually
7. User taps "Check OAuth Status" to verify authentication

## Testing the Configuration

After completing the setup:
1. Restart your app
2. Try the "Continue with Google" option
3. The OAuth flow should now work without the "Invalid URI" error

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Verify Web Platform Configuration**: Make sure you've added a Web platform with hostname `ekehi-oauth.netlify.app`
2. **Check Google OAuth credentials**: Ensure your Client ID and Secret are correct
3. **Clear app cache**: Restart your development server and clear app cache

## Important Notes

- The hosted OAuth system requires a Web platform configuration in Appwrite
- Users must manually return to the app after completing OAuth on the hosted system
- The "Check OAuth Status" button is used to verify authentication after returning from the hosted system
- Deep linking is not used with the hosted OAuth system
