## Configuration Requirements

To ensure proper OAuth functionality, make sure the following configurations are in place:

### Appwrite Console Configuration
1. Add a new platform:
   - Type: Flutter/React Native
   - Name: Mobile App
   - Package/Bundle ID: com.ekehi.network
2. Add redirect URLs:
   - ekehi://oauth/return
   - ekehi://auth

### Google Cloud Console Configuration
Ensure the OAuth client IDs are properly configured in the Appwrite configuration file.

## Testing

The authentication system has been tested with:
- Email/password authentication
- Google OAuth on both web and mobile platforms
- Error scenarios including network failures and invalid credentials
