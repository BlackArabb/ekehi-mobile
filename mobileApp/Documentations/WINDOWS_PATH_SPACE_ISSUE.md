# Windows Path Space Issue in Android Build

## Issue
When building the Android release APK, the build fails with the error:
```
'C:\Users\ARQAM' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

This error occurs because there is a space in the username ("ARQAM TV"), which causes issues with command execution in the Windows command prompt during the build process.

## Root Cause
The issue is caused by the space in the user profile path `C:\Users\ARQAM TV\`. When Gradle executes certain commands during the build process, it doesn't properly handle paths with spaces, leading to the command being interpreted incorrectly.

## Progress Made
We've successfully resolved the previous issues:
1. Added `@react-native/assets-registry` to dependencies
2. Added `babel-preset-expo` to devDependencies

These fixes allowed the build to progress past the "Cannot find module" errors and successfully bundle the JavaScript assets.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Use Short Path Names (8.3 Format)
Windows maintains short path names (8.3 format) for compatibility. We can try using the short path name for the user directory.

### 2. Move Project to Path Without Spaces
Move the project to a directory without spaces in the path, such as `C:\projects\ekehi-mobile`.

### 3. Use Symbolic Links
Create a symbolic link from a path without spaces to the current project location.

### 4. Modify Environment Variables
Set environment variables to use short path names where possible.

## Recommended Approach
The most reliable solution is to move the project to a path without spaces. If that's not possible, creating a symbolic link is the next best option.

## Commands to Try

1. Check short path name:
   ```cmd
   dir /x C:\Users\
   ```

2. Create symbolic link (requires admin privileges):
   ```cmd
   mklink /D C:\ekehi-mobile "C:\Users\ARQAM TV\Downloads\mobile"
   ```

3. Build from the symbolic link path:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\ekehi-mobile\android && gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

## Alternative Solutions

1. Use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt for building
2. Set up a development environment in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
3. Use a CI/CD pipeline for building releases

## Additional Notes
This is a common Windows issue when working with development tools that don't properly handle paths with spaces. It's not specific to React Native or Expo, but affects many build tools on Windows.
