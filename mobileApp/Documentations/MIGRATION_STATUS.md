# Ekehi Network Migration Status

## Current State

The migration from Mocha to direct Cloudflare hosting has been successfully completed, and we are now migrating to Appwrite with the following components:

### Cloudflare Workers (Deprecated - Migrating to Appwrite)
- ✅ API deployed at: `https://ekehi-network-api.alghareeb-mk.workers.dev`
- ✅ All endpoints implemented and working
- ✅ D1 database configured and migrated
- ✅ Google OAuth authentication flow implemented
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ CORS properly configured

### Frontend (Vercel)
- ✅ Web app deployed at: `https://ekehi-network-nojxotiyc-kamal-s-projects.vercel.app`
- ✅ All pages accessible and routing working correctly
- ✅ OAuth return page correctly redirects to `/mine` after authentication

### Mobile App
- ✅ Pointing to Cloudflare backend (migrating to Appwrite)
- ✅ Authentication flow working for both web and mobile
- ✅ All API endpoints updated in configuration

## Appwrite Migration Status

See [APPWRITE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md](APPWRITE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md) for detailed migration progress.

## Authentication Flow (Current - Cloudflare)

### Mobile Authentication
1. User taps "Continue with Google" in the app
2. App opens Google OAuth page
3. User authenticates with Google
4. Google redirects to Cloudflare Worker callback: `/api/oauth/callback`
5. Cloudflare Worker redirects back to app with deep link: `ekehi://auth?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE`
6. App exchanges authorization code for JWT token via `/api/sessions` endpoint
7. User is logged in and redirected to main app

### Web Authentication (Testing Only)
1. User visits Vercel-deployed app: `https://ekehi-network-nojxotiyc-kamal-s-projects.vercel.app`
2. User clicks "Continue with Google"
3. Page redirects to Google OAuth page
4. User authenticates with Google
5. Google redirects to OAuth return page: `https://ekehi-network-api.alghareeb-mk.workers.dev/oauth/return?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE`
6. Return page exchanges authorization code for JWT token via `/api/sessions` endpoint
7. Token is stored in localStorage
8. User is redirected to the mine page: `https://ekehi-network-nojxotiyc-kamal-s-projects.vercel.app/mine`

## Testing

All components have been tested and are working correctly with Cloudflare:

- ✅ Cloudflare Worker API endpoints responding
- ✅ Database queries working
- ✅ Google OAuth flow completing
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ Vercel frontend deployment accessible
- ✅ OAuth return page redirecting correctly

## Next Steps

1. Complete Appwrite project setup
2. Migrate data from Cloudflare D1 to Appwrite Database
3. Update mobile app to use Appwrite SDK
4. Remove Cloudflare backend dependencies
5. Conduct thorough testing of all features
6. Update documentation with new processes

## URLs Summary

- **Cloudflare Worker API** (deprecated): `https://ekehi-network-api.alghareeb-mk.workers.dev`
- **Vercel Frontend**: `https://ekehi-network-nojxotiyc-kamal-s-projects.vercel.app`
- **Mobile App Scheme**: `ekehi://`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Authentication errors**: Verify Google OAuth credentials and redirect URIs
2. **Database errors**: Check D1 database configuration and migrations
3. **Deployment errors**: Ensure all secrets are properly set in Cloudflare
4. **Routing issues**: Verify wrangler.toml configuration
5. **Frontend issues**: Check Vercel deployment logs
