# Build Issue Resolution Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the issues encountered during the Android release build process and the solutions implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. PNPM Dependency Issues
**Problem**: Missing modules during Android release build:
- `@react-native/assets-registry/registry.js`
- `babel-preset-expo`

**Root Cause**: PNPM-specific issue where dependencies that are transitively included in pnpm-lock.yaml still need to be explicitly declared in package.json to be available during the build process.

**Solution**: Added missing dependencies to package.json:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native/assets-registry": "0.74.87",
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-preset-expo": "~11.0.0",
    // ... other devDependencies
  }
}
```

**Result**: Build progressed past the "Cannot find module" errors and successfully bundled JavaScript assets.

### 2. Windows Path Space Issue
**Problem**: Build failing with error:
```
'C:\Users\ARQAM' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

**Root Cause**: Space in the user profile path `C:\Users\ARQAM TV\` causing issues with command execution in Windows command prompt.

**Solution**: Using short path name (8.3 format) to avoid spaces:
- Short path name for "ARQAM TV" is "ARQAMT~1"
- Building from: `C:\Users\ARQAMT~1\Downloads\mobile\android`

**Result**: Build successfully progresses through configuration and dependency resolution phases.

## Current Status
The build is currently in the JavaScript bundling phase, which can take several minutes to complete. The fixes we've implemented have successfully resolved the previous blocking issues.

## Files Created
1. PNPM_ANDROID_BUILD_FIX.md - Detailed documentation of PNPM dependency fixes
2. PNPM_ANDROID_BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md - Summary of PNPM fixes
3. WINDOWS_PATH_SPACE_ISSUE.md - Documentation of Windows path space issue and solutions
4. BUILD_ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md - This file

## Next Steps
1. Wait for the current build to complete
2. Check for the generated APK in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`
3. If build succeeds, test the APK on a device
4. If build fails, analyze the new error and apply additional fixes

## Alternative Solutions if Current Approach Fails
1. Move project to path without spaces (e.g., `C:\projects\ekehi-mobile`)
2. Create symbolic link from path without spaces to current location
3. Use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt for building
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for building releases
5. Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for building

## Lessons Learned
1. PNPM requires explicit declaration of all dependencies in package.json
2. Windows path spaces can cause issues with build tools
3. Short path names (8.3 format) can be used as workaround for path spaces
4. Incremental fixes are effective for complex build issues
