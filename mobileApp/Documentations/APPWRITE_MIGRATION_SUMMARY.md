2. Transform data to match Appwrite collection schemas
3. Import data into Appwrite database
4. Validate migrated data

### Testing
1. Test authentication flows (Google OAuth, Email/Password)
2. Test data operations (CRUD operations on all collections)
3. Test cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)
4. Performance testing

### Documentation Updates
