# Manual Mining System Update

## Overview

This document details the changes made to the manual mining system in the Ekehi Network mobile app. The manual mining system has been updated from a per-click model to a 24-hour session model where users earn a fixed 2 EKH reward for completing a 24-hour mining session.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed coinsPerClick from UserProfile

The `coinsPerClick` property has been removed from the `UserProfile` interface as it is no longer used in the new mining system.

**Before:**
```typescript
export interface UserProfile {
  // ... other properties
  coinsPerClick: number;
  // ... other properties
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export interface UserProfile {
  // ... other properties
  // coinsPerClick has been removed as manual mining now works on a 24-hour session basis
  // ... other properties
}
```

### 2. Updated Mining Logic

The manual mining logic has been changed from a per-click earning system to a 24-hour session system:

**Before:**
- Users earned `coinsPerClick` EKH tokens for each tap on the mining button
- Mining rate could vary based on user properties
- Users could mine continuously throughout the day

**After:**
- Users start a 24-hour mining session with a single tap
- Users earn a fixed 2 EKH reward at the end of the 24-hour session
- The hourly mining rate is displayed as 0.0833 EKH/hour (2 EKH รท 24 hours)

### 3. Updated Mining Rate Display

The mining rate display has been updated to show a fixed 0.0833 EKH/hour rate:

**In mine.tsx:**
```typescript
<View style={styles.statCard}>
    <TrendingUp size={20} color="#10b981" />
    <Text style={styles.statValue}>
        0.0833
    </Text>
    <Text style={styles.statLabel}>EKH/hour</Text>
</View>
```

### 4. Updated Mining Context

The `performMine` function in the MiningContext has been updated to track session clicks without immediately adding coins:

**Before:**
```typescript
const newTotalCoins = profile.totalCoins + profile.coinsPerClick;
const newTodayEarnings = profile.todayEarnings + profile.coinsPerClick;

// Update user profile with new mining data
const updatedProfile = {
  ...profile,
  totalCoins: newTotalCoins,
  todayEarnings: newTodayEarnings,
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// For the new 24-hour session mining, we don't add coins immediately
// Instead, we track the session and add the reward at the end
// The 2 EKH reward is added when the 24-hour session completes

// Update local states efficiently to track the mining session
setSessionClicks(prev => prev + 1);
```

## How the New System Works

### 1. Starting a Mining Session
- User taps the mining button once to start a 24-hour session
- A countdown timer begins showing the remaining time
- The mining button becomes disabled during the session

### 2. During the Mining Session
- User sees a visual progress indicator
- User sees the remaining time until reward collection
- The mining button remains disabled

### 3. Completing the Mining Session
- After 24 hours, the mining button changes to allow claiming the reward
- User taps the button to claim their 2 EKH reward
- The reward is added to their total coin balance

### 4. Hourly Mining Rate
- The displayed hourly mining rate is fixed at 0.0833 EKH/hour
- This represents 2 EKH รท 24 hours
- All users see the same rate regardless of their profile

## Benefits of the New System

### 1. Simplicity
- Users only need to tap once to start mining
- Clear, predictable reward system
- Easy to understand time-based mechanics

### 2. Consistency
- All users earn the same reward for the same time commitment
- No complex calculations or variable rates
- Predictable earnings for users

### 3. Engagement
- Encourages daily app interaction to check mining progress
- Creates anticipation for reward collection
- Builds routine usage patterns

## Technical Implementation

### 1. UserProfile Changes
- Removed `coinsPerClick` property
- Maintained `dailyMiningRate` at 2 EKH for compatibility with existing displays
- Updated user profile creation to not include `coinsPerClick`

### 2. Mining Context Updates
- Modified `performMine` function to track session clicks only
- Maintained session tracking functionality
- Updated user profile mapping to exclude `coinsPerClick`

### 3. UI Updates
- Updated mining rate display to show fixed 0.0833 EKH/hour
- Maintained existing visual components and styling
- Preserved all other mining UI elements

## Files Modified

1. `src/types/index.ts` - Removed `coinsPerClick` from `UserProfile` interface
2. `src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx` - Updated `performMine` function and profile mapping
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated user profile creation
4. `app/(tabs)/mine.tsx` - Updated mining rate display to fixed 0.0833 EKH/hour
5. `Documentations/MANUAL_MINING_SYSTEM_UPDATE.md` - This documentation file

## Testing

The changes have been verified to ensure:

1. UserProfile no longer includes `coinsPerClick`
2. Mining context correctly tracks session clicks without adding coins
3. Mining rate display shows fixed 0.0833 EKH/hour
4. User profile creation works without `coinsPerClick`
5. Existing functionality remains intact
6. No TypeScript errors or compilation issues

## Future Considerations

### 1. Tiered Rewards
Consider implementing different reward tiers based on user achievements or referrals.

### 2. Bonus Multipliers
Add special event multipliers that could increase the 2 EKH base reward.

### 3. Social Features
Implement social sharing of mining sessions or rewards to increase engagement.
