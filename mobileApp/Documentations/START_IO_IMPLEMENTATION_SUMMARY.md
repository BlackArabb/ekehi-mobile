# Start.io Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Start.io (formerly StartApp) rewarded ads in the Ekehi Mobile application, replacing the previous Google AdMob integration.

## Overview

The Ekehi Mobile application has been updated to use Start.io for advertising services instead of Google AdMob. This change affects the Android platform only, as Start.io currently only supports Android.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Start.io Service

- Created `src/services/StartIoService.ts` to handle Start.io SDK integration
- Provides the same interface as the previous AdMob service for loading and showing rewarded ads
- Supports Android platform only (iOS and web show "Ads Unavailable" message)

### 2. Dependency Updates

**package.json:**
- Removed: `react-native-google-mobile-ads`
- Added: `react-native-startio-ads`

### 3. Configuration Updates

**app.json:**
- Removed AdMob configuration for both iOS and Android
- Removed `react-native-google-mobile-ads` plugin

### 4. Code Updates

**src/components/AdMobWrapper.tsx â†’ src/components/StartIoWrapper.tsx:**
- Renamed file and component
- Updated to use StartIoService instead of AdMobService
- Changed platform support from "not web" to "Android only"

**src/components/AdModal.tsx:**
- Updated to use StartIoService instead of AdMobService
- Changed platform support from "not web" to "Android only"
- Updated event logging to reflect Start.io instead of AdMob

**app/(tabs)/mine.tsx:**
- Updated to use StartIoService instead of AdMobService
- Changed platform support from "not web" to "Android only"
- Updated ad view recording to use "startio_bonus" instead of generic "bonus"

### 5. Documentation

- Created `START_IO_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` explaining the migration process
- Updated `README.md` to reference the new documentation
- Added note about advertising rewards to key features

## Implementation Details

### Start.io Service Features

The new `StartIoService.ts` provides:

- `initialize()`: Initializes the Start.io SDK with your App ID
- `loadRewardedAd()`: Loads a rewarded ad
- `showRewardedAd()`: Shows a rewarded ad and returns the result with reward amount
- `getAppId()`: Returns the Start.io App ID
- `isStartIoInitialized()`: Checks if Start.io is initialized
- `isStartIoAvailable()`: Checks if Start.io is available on the current platform
- `getModuleLoadError()`: Returns any module loading errors
- `setAppId()`: Sets a custom App ID (useful for testing)

### Platform Support

- **Android**: Full support for rewarded ads
- **iOS**: Not supported (shows "Ads Unavailable" message)
- **Web**: Not supported (shows "Ads Unavailable" message)

### Testing

The implementation includes test controls in development mode to simulate:
- Successful ad completion
- Ad error scenarios

## Configuration

To configure Start.io for your application:

1. Obtain your Start.io App ID from the Start.io developer portal
2. Replace `YOUR_START_IO_APP_ID` in `src/services/StartIoService.ts` with your actual App ID
3. For Android, follow the manual installation steps in the `react-native-startio-ads` documentation

## Usage

The Start.io integration works the same way as the previous AdMob integration:

1. Users can watch rewarded ads to earn bonus EKH tokens
2. A 5-minute cooldown period is enforced between ad views
3. Rewards are automatically added to the user's balance
4. Ad views are recorded in the database for analytics

## Limitations

1. **Platform Support**: Currently only supports Android
2. **Manual Installation**: Requires manual setup steps for Android
3. **Limited Testing**: Only basic rewarded ad functionality is implemented

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for additional ad formats (banner ads, interstitial ads)
2. Implement more detailed analytics and tracking
3. Add iOS support when Start.io SDK becomes available for iOS
4. Implement advanced features like ad frequency capping

## Troubleshooting

If ads are not showing:

1. Verify your Start.io App ID is correct
2. Check that the Start.io SDK is properly installed
3. Ensure you're testing on a physical Android device (emulators may not work)
4. Check the console logs for any error messages
5. Verify network connectivity

This implementation maintains the same user experience as the previous AdMob integration while switching to the Start.io advertising network.
