# Manual Mining System Update - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

The previous manual mining system used a per-click model where users earned `coinsPerClick` tokens for each tap. This system has been replaced with a 24-hour session model where users earn a fixed 2 EKH reward for completing a 24-hour mining session.

## Solution Implemented

I implemented a new 24-hour session mining system by making the following changes:

### 1. Updated UserProfile Type ([src/types/index.ts](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/mobileApp/src/types/index.ts))
- Removed `coinsPerClick` property from `UserProfile` interface
- Updated documentation to explain the removal

### 2. Updated Mining Context ([src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/mobileApp/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx))
- Modified `performMine` function to track session clicks without immediately adding coins
- Updated user profile mapping to exclude `coinsPerClick`
- Maintained session tracking functionality

### 3. Updated Auth Context ([src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/mobileApp/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx))
- Updated user profile creation to not include `coinsPerClick`
- Set `dailyMiningRate` to 2 EKH for compatibility with existing displays

### 4. Updated Mine Page ([app/(tabs)/mine.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/mobileApp/app/(tabs)/mine.tsx))
- Updated mining rate display to show fixed 0.0833 EKH/hour
- Maintained existing visual components and styling

## Key Features of the New System

1. **24-Hour Session Mining**: Users start a 24-hour mining session with a single tap
2. **Fixed Reward**: Earn a guaranteed 2 EKH reward for completing a 24-hour session
3. **Visual Progress Tracking**: Real-time countdown and progress indicators
4. **Fixed Hourly Rate**: Display shows consistent 0.0833 EKH/hour rate (2 EKH รท 24 hours)
5. **Simplified Mechanics**: Easy to understand time-based reward system

## How It Works

### Starting a Mining Session
- User taps the mining button once to start a 24-hour session
- A countdown timer begins showing the remaining time
- The mining button becomes disabled during the session

### During the Mining Session
- User sees a visual progress indicator
- User sees the remaining time until reward collection
- The mining button remains disabled

### Completing the Mining Session
- After 24 hours, the mining button changes to allow claiming the reward
- User taps the button to claim their 2 EKH reward
- The reward is added to their total coin balance

### Hourly Mining Rate
- The displayed hourly mining rate is fixed at 0.0833 EKH/hour
- This represents 2 EKH รท 24 hours
- All users see the same rate regardless of their profile

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Users only need to tap once to start mining
2. **Predictability**: Clear, fixed reward system that's easy to understand
3. **Engagement**: Encourages daily app interaction to check mining progress
4. **Consistency**: All users earn the same reward for the same time commitment
