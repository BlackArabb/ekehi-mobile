# Mining Session Recording Issue - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

The user reported that "mining sessions and other aspects that require token award are not being recorded." Upon investigation, I found that:

1. The app had a [MiningContext](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L15-L32) with [startMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L155-L158) and [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) functions
2. The [startMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L155-L158) function was being called when users entered the mining page
3. However, the [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) function was never actually called to record the session data
4. There was no implementation to create records in the `mining_sessions` collection in Appwrite

## Solution Implemented

I implemented a comprehensive solution to record mining sessions by making the following changes:

### 1. Enhanced MiningContext ([src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx))

- Added session start time tracking with a new `sessionStartTime` state variable
- Modified [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) to be asynchronous and call a new `recordMiningSession()` function
- Implemented `recordMiningSession()` function that:
  - Calculates session duration
  - Filters out sessions shorter than 5 seconds to prevent spam
  - Creates records in the Appwrite `mining_sessions` collection with all relevant data
  - Includes userId, coinsEarned, clicksMade, and sessionDuration

### 2. Updated Mine Page ([app/(tabs)/mine.tsx](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/app/(tabs)/mine.tsx))

- Added [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) to the component's useEffect cleanup function
- Ensures that when users navigate away from the mining page, their session is properly recorded

### 3. Enhanced AutoMiningStatus Component ([src/components/AutoMiningStatus.tsx](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/components/AutoMiningStatus.tsx))

- Added the [useMining](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L170-L176) hook to access [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161)
- Integrated [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) into the component's cleanup function
- Added explicit calls to [endMiningSession](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/MiningContext.tsx#L159-L161) when users stop auto mining

## Key Features of the Solution

1. **Automatic Session Recording**: Sessions are recorded automatically when users navigate away from mining activities
2. **Spam Prevention**: Sessions shorter than 5 seconds are not recorded to prevent database spam
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both manual mining and auto mining sessions are recorded
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling ensures that session recording failures don't break the app
5. **Performance Optimized**: Session recording happens asynchronously and doesn't block UI interactions

## Data Structure

Each mining session record in the Appwrite database contains:
- `userId`: The ID of the user who performed the mining
- `coinsEarned`: Total coins earned during the session
- `clicksMade`: Number of mining clicks performed
- `sessionDuration`: Duration of the session in seconds
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when the session was recorded

## Verification

The solution can be verified by:
1. Performing mining activities in the app
2. Navigating away from the mining page or backgrounding the app
3. Checking the Appwrite dashboard for new documents in the `mining_sessions` collection
4. Confirming that the session data matches the user's mining activity

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in:
- [docs/MINING_SESSION_RECORDING.md](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/docs/MINING_SESSION_RECORDING.md) - Detailed implementation documentation
- Updated README.md with a new section explaining the mining session recording feature

This solution ensures that all mining sessions are properly recorded, enabling better analytics, rewards tracking, and user engagement metrics for the Ekehi Network platform.

# Dynamic Mining Rate Implementation - Solution Summary

## Problem Identified

The user reported that "the fixed rate value is the correct value for the mining rate but it should be dynamic not fixed". Upon investigation, I found that:

1. The mining rate was displayed using a fixed calculation `(2 / 24).toFixed(4)` which always showed 0.0833 EKH/hour
2. This approach didn't account for users with different mining powers or bonuses
3. The displayed rate wasn't personalized to each user's actual mining capability

## Solution Implemented

I implemented a dynamic mining rate calculation by making the following changes:

### 1. Updated Mine Page ([app/(tabs)/mine.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/app/(tabs)/mine.tsx))

- Replaced the fixed calculation with a dynamic one based on user profile data
- Changed from `(2 / 24).toFixed(4)` to `{profile ? (profile.dailyMiningRate / 24).toFixed(4) : '0.0000'}`
- Now displays each user's actual hourly mining rate based on their profile

### 2. Verified Profile Page ([app/(tabs)/profile.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx))

- Confirmed that the profile page already had the correct dynamic calculation
- Maintained consistency between both pages

## Key Features of the Solution

1. **Personalization**: Each user sees their actual mining rate based on their profile data
2. **Accuracy**: The displayed rate accurately reflects what the user will earn per hour
3. **Scalability**: Future mining rate adjustments will automatically be reflected
4. **Fallback Handling**: Properly handles cases where profile data is not available

## How It Works

- **Standard User**: A user with a `dailyMiningRate` of 2 EKH will see 0.0833 EKH/hour (2 รท 24 = 0.0833)
- **Power User**: A user with a `dailyMiningRate` of 4 EKH will see 0.1667 EKH/hour (4 รท 24 = 0.1667)
- **No Profile**: If no profile data is available, it defaults to 0.0000 EKH/hour

## Verification

The solution can be verified by:
1. Checking different user accounts with varying mining powers
2. Verifying that the displayed rate matches `dailyMiningRate / 24`
3. Confirming that referral bonuses properly affect the displayed rate
4. Testing with accounts that have no profile data to ensure proper fallback

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in:
- [Documentations/DYNAMIC_MINING_RATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/Documentations/DYNAMIC_MINING_RATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Detailed implementation documentation
- Updated README.md with a new feature highlighting dynamic mining rates
- Updated FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md with information about the dynamic mining rate feature

This solution ensures that all users see their personalized mining rate, providing a more accurate and engaging experience in the Ekehi Network platform.
