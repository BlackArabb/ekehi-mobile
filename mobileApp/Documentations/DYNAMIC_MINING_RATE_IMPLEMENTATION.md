# Dynamic Mining Rate Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of dynamic mining rate calculations in the Ekehi Network mobile app. Previously, the mining rate was displayed using a fixed calculation, but it has now been updated to use dynamic values based on each user's profile data.

## Problem Statement

The previous implementation used a fixed calculation `(2 / 24).toFixed(4)` which always displayed 0.0833 EKH/hour regardless of the user's actual mining rate. This approach didn't account for:

1. Users with different mining powers
2. Mining rate bonuses from referrals or achievements
3. Future mining rate adjustments based on user progression

## Solution

The mining rate calculation has been updated to use dynamic values from the user's profile data. The new calculation divides the user's `dailyMiningRate` by 24 to get the hourly rate:

```typescript
// Dynamic calculation based on user's profile
const hourlyMiningRate = profile.dailyMiningRate / 24;
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Mine Page ([mine.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/app/(tabs)/mine.tsx))

**Before:**
```typescript
<Text style={styles.statValue}>{(2 / 24).toFixed(4)}</Text>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Text style={styles.statValue}>
  {profile ? (profile.dailyMiningRate / 24).toFixed(4) : '0.0000'}
</Text>
```

### 2. Profile Page ([profile.tsx](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx))

**Before/After (already correctly implemented):**
```typescript
<Text style={styles.statValue}>
  {profile?.dailyMiningRate ? (profile.dailyMiningRate / 24).toFixed(4) : '0.0000'}
</Text>
```

## How It Works

1. **Standard User**: A user with a `dailyMiningRate` of 2 EKH will see 0.0833 EKH/hour (2 รท 24 = 0.0833)
2. **Power User**: A user with a `dailyMiningRate` of 4 EKH will see 0.1667 EKH/hour (4 รท 24 = 0.1667)
3. **No Profile**: If no profile data is available, it defaults to 0.0000 EKH/hour

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Each user sees their actual mining rate based on their profile
2. **Accuracy**: The displayed rate accurately reflects what the user will earn
3. **Scalability**: Future mining rate adjustments will automatically be reflected
4. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly how their mining power affects their earnings

## Verification

To verify that the dynamic mining rate is working correctly:

1. Check different user accounts with varying mining powers
2. Verify that the displayed rate matches `dailyMiningRate / 24`
3. Confirm that referral bonuses properly affect the displayed rate
4. Test with accounts that have no profile data to ensure proper fallback

## Related Systems

This change affects:
- Mining rate display on the Mine page
- Mining rate display on the Profile page
- Any future calculations based on hourly mining rates

## Future Considerations

1. **Real-time Updates**: The mining rate will automatically update when profile data changes
2. **Achievement Bonuses**: Future achievement bonuses will be immediately reflected
3. **Seasonal Events**: Special event mining rate multipliers will be automatically displayed
