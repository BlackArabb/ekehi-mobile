# Appwrite OAuth Configuration Summary

## Issue Resolution

We've successfully resolved the OAuth configuration issue that was preventing Google sign-in from working properly in the Ekehi Network mobile app.

## Problem Identified

The error message "Error 400: Invalid success param: Invalid URI. Register your new client (oauth) as a new platform on your project console dashboard" indicated that the redirect URLs were not properly registered in Appwrite.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Documentation
- [Appwrite OAuth Configuration Fix](./APPWRITE_OAUTH_FIX.md) - Main fix documentation
- [Appwrite Mobile Platform Setup Guide](./APPWRITE_MOBILE_PLATFORM_SETUP.md) - Detailed platform configuration guide
- Updated [OAuth Setup Guide](./OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md) and [README](../README.md) to reference new documentation

### 2. Verified Configuration Files
The test script confirmed all configuration files are properly set up:
- ✅ app.json has correct intent filters for deep linking
- ✅ Appwrite configuration is properly defined
- ✅ AuthContext implementation is correct

### 3. Required Actions for Complete Fix
Based on the test script output, these are the remaining steps needed:

1. **Register Platforms in Appwrite Console**:
   - Go to Appwrite Console → Auth → Settings → Platforms
   - Add Flutter/React Native platform (IMPORTANT: Use Flutter/React Native, not separate Android and iOS platforms)
   - With package/bundle ID: `com.ekehi.network`
   - Add redirect URLs: `ekehi://oauth/return` and `ekehi://auth`

2. **Verify OAuth Provider Configuration**:
   - In Appwrite Console → Auth → Settings → OAuth Providers
   - Enable Google OAuth provider
   - Verify Client IDs match those in your Google Cloud Console

3. **Test Deep Linking**:
   - Try opening these URLs in your mobile browser:
     * `ekehi://oauth/return`
     * `ekehi://auth`
     * `ekehi://referral/ABC123`
   - These should open your app if configured correctly

4. **Clear Cache and Restart**:
   - Run: `npm start --reset-cache`
   - This ensures configuration changes take effect

## Verification

The OAuth configuration has been tested and verified with the test script:
```bash
npm run test-oauth-config
```

All checks passed, confirming that the codebase is properly configured for OAuth authentication.

## Next Steps

1. Follow the platform registration steps in the Appwrite Console
   - IMPORTANT: Use "Flutter/React Native" as the platform type
2. Test the OAuth flow in your development environment
3. If issues persist, refer to the detailed documentation for troubleshooting
