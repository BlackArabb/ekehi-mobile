   - Integrated with new AdMob service
   - Maintained backward compatibility

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Test Mode
- Automatic detection of development environment
- Visual TEST MODE indicator in UI
- Simulation controls for testing scenarios
- Event logging for debugging

#### Production Mode
- Real AdMob rewarded ads
- Proper event handling (reward, dismiss, error)
- Loading states and user feedback
- Error recovery mechanisms

#### Reward System
- Dynamic reward amounts based on ad performance
- Database recording of ad views
- User balance updates
- Cooldown management

#### Event Tracking
- Comprehensive event logging
- Debug information for troubleshooting
- User interaction monitoring

### 4. Ad Unit Integration

#### Production Ad Unit IDs
- **Rewarded Ad Unit**: `ca-app-pub-6750107449379811/9311091493` (Ekehi Bonus)
- **App ID**: `ca-app-pub-6750107449379811~7479135078` (Ekehi-Network-T)

#### Test Ad Unit IDs
- **Test Rewarded Ad Unit**: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1712485313`
- **Test App ID**: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713`

#### Testing Scenarios
- Successful ad completion with rewards
- Ad loading failures
- User-initiated ad skipping
- Network error handling

### 5. User Experience

#### Ad Flow
1. User clicks "Watch Ad for +0.5 EKH" button
2. AdModal appears with reward information
3. Ad loads (with loading indicator)
4. User watches ad or cancels
5. Reward is processed and added to user balance
6. Cooldown activates (5 minutes)

#### UI Enhancements
- Loading indicators during ad preparation
- Clear reward information display
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Test mode indicators for development

### 6. Technical Implementation

#### AdMob Service
- Singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Platform-specific handling (iOS/Android)
- Event listener management
- Error handling and recovery

#### Component Integration
- Seamless integration with existing UI
- Backward compatibility with test simulations
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Proper error boundaries

#### Data Management
- Appwrite database integration for ad view recording
- User profile updates for reward distribution
- AsyncStorage for cooldown management
- Notification system for user feedback

## Testing

### Development Testing
- TEST MODE indicator in UI
- Simulation buttons for various scenarios
- Console logging of all events
- Immediate feedback for actions

### Production Testing
- Real AdMob ad loading and display
- Actual reward processing
- Database integration verification
- Error handling validation

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Readiness
- Test vs. production ad unit separation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

### Monitoring
- Event tracking for analytics
- Error reporting for issue identification
- User engagement metrics
- Revenue tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Ad Formats
