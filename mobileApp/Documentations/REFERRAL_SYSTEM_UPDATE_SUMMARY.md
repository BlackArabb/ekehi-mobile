# Ekehi Network Referral System Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the referral system to implement the new reward structure as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Referral Context (`src/contexts/ReferralContext.tsx`)
- Modified the [claimReferral](file:///c:/ekehi-mobile/src/contexts/ReferralContext.tsx#L137-L180) function to implement the new reward system:
  - Referrer now receives an increased mining rate of 0.2 EKH/second per referral instead of direct coins
  - Referee now receives 2 EKH instead of 0.5 EKH
  - Added a maximum referral limit of 50 referrals per user
  - Updated error messages to reflect the new system

### 2. Profile Screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)
- Updated the referral statistics display to show:
  - 0.2 EKH per referral (mining rate increase)
  - 2.0 EKH for referred users

### 3. Referral Screen (`src/components/ReferralScreen.tsx`)
- Updated the claim referral description to indicate the user will receive 2 EKH
- Updated the claim button text to "Claim 2 EKH"

### 4. Documentation (`Documentations/REFERRAL_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Completely updated the documentation to reflect the new referral system:
  - New reward structure
  - Maximum referral limit
  - Updated user flows
  - Updated implementation details

### 5. Test Script (`Scripts/test-referral-system.js`)
- Updated the test script to reflect the new reward system:
  - Referrer receives increased mining rate instead of coins
  - Referee receives 2 EKH instead of 0.5 EKH

## New Referral System Details

### For Referrers (Users sharing their referral code):
- Receive no direct EKH coins
- Mining rate increases by 0.2 EKH/second for each successful referral
- Maximum of 50 referrals allowed per user

### For Referees (Users using a referral code):
- Receive 2 EKH coins immediately upon successful referral claim
- No maximum limit on being referred (can only be referred once)

### Implementation Notes:
- The mining rate increase is cumulative (0.2 EKH/second Ã— number of referrals)
- All updates are reflected in real-time in the user profiles
- Proper validation prevents users from exceeding the 50-referral limit
- Self-referral prevention remains in place

## Testing
The updated test script can be run with:
```bash
node Scripts/test-referral-system.js
```

This will create two test users, simulate a referral, and verify the new reward system is working correctly.
