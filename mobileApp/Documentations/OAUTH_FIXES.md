# OAuth Authentication Fixes

This document explains the issues that were identified and fixed in the Google OAuth authentication flow.

## Issues Identified

1. **Infinite Loading**: The OAuth flow would load indefinitely without reaching the Google consent page
2. **Timeout Issues**: No timeout handling for OAuth requests, causing the app to hang
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Inadequate error messages for common OAuth failures
4. **Missing Retry Logic**: OAuth return page didn't have retry mechanisms for failed auth checks

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Timeout Handling
- Added timeout promises to prevent indefinite loading
- Implemented 30-second timeout for both OAuth URL generation and browser session
- Added user-friendly timeout error messages

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific error messages for timeout scenarios
- Improved error reporting with clearer user guidance
- Added platform-specific error handling

### 3. Retry Logic
- Added retry mechanism in OAuth return page (up to 3 attempts)
- Implemented proper cleanup of timeouts to prevent memory leaks
- Added better state management to prevent duplicate navigations

### 4. Improved User Feedback
- Added clearer loading messages
- Enhanced timeout error messages with actionable guidance
- Improved overall user experience during OAuth flow

## Technical Details

### AuthContext.tsx Changes
- Added timeout promises using `Promise.race()` to prevent hanging
- Implemented 30-second timeout for OAuth operations
- Added specific error handling for timeout scenarios
- Improved error messages with user-friendly guidance

### OAuthReturnPage.tsx Changes
- Added retry logic for auth status checks (up to 3 attempts)
- Implemented proper cleanup of timeouts
- Enhanced state management to prevent duplicate navigations
- Added attempt counting for better debugging

### AuthPage.tsx Changes
- Added timeout error handling with specific user guidance
- Ensured loading state is properly reset even on errors
- Improved error messages for better user experience

## Testing

The OAuth authentication flow has been tested with:
- Timeout scenarios (simulated by adding delays)
- Network failure scenarios
- Successful authentication flows
- Error handling scenarios

## Files Modified

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Core OAuth logic with timeout handling
- `app/oauth/return.tsx` - OAuth callback handling with retry logic
- `app/auth.tsx` - Authentication UI with improved error handling
- `OAUTH_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## Configuration Requirements

To ensure proper OAuth functionality, make sure the following configurations are in place:

### Appwrite Console Configuration
1. Add a new platform:
   - Type: Flutter/React Native
   - Name: Mobile App
   - Package/Bundle ID: com.ekehi.network
2. Add redirect URLs:
   - ekehi://oauth/return
   - ekehi://auth

### Google Cloud Console Configuration
Ensure the OAuth client IDs are properly configured in the Appwrite configuration file.

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check your Appwrite OAuth configuration
2. Verify Google OAuth client IDs are correct
3. Ensure redirect URLs are properly registered
4. Check network connectivity
5. Clear browser cache and try again
