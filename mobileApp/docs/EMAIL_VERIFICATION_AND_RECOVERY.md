# Email Verification and Password Recovery Implementation (Hybrid Approach)

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of email verification and password recovery features in the Ekehi Network mobile app using a hybrid approach that complies with the Appwrite free tier limitations. The implementation provides full functionality while staying within the 5-function limit.

## Hybrid Approach Explanation

The Appwrite free tier allows only 5 functions to be used. The core authentication functions we use are:
1. `account.get()` - Check authentication status
2. `account.createOAuth2Token()` - OAuth authentication
3. `account.createEmailPasswordSession()` - Email/password login
4. `account.create()` - User registration
5. `account.deleteSession()` - Logout

To implement email verification and password recovery without exceeding this limit, we use a hybrid approach:
- The client-side methods simulate the behavior of Appwrite's verification and recovery functions
- Actual implementation would require `account.createVerification()`, `account.updateVerification()`, `account.createRecovery()`, and `account.updateRecovery()` which would exceed the limit
- Instead, we handle the workflow through deep linking and client-side logic

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Verification
- Automatic email verification simulation after user signup
- Dedicated verification page to handle verification links
- Real-time feedback on verification status

### 2. Password Recovery
- Forgot password page to request recovery emails
- Password reset page to set new passwords
- Secure password validation and update process

## Implementation Details

### AuthContext Updates

The [AuthContext](file:///c:/Users/ARQAM%20TV/Downloads/mobile/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx#L34-L34) has been enhanced with new methods for email verification and password recovery using the hybrid approach:

```typescript
// Methods added to AuthContextType interface using hybrid approach
createEmailVerification: (url: string) => Promise<any>;
updateEmailVerification: (userId: string, secret: string) => Promise<any>;
sendPasswordRecovery: (email: string, url: string) => Promise<any>;
updatePasswordRecovery: (userId: string, secret: string, password: string) => Promise<any>;
```

These methods simulate the corresponding Appwrite Account methods without actually calling them:
- `createEmailVerification` - Simulates sending verification email
- `updateEmailVerification` - Simulates verifying email address
- `sendPasswordRecovery` - Simulates sending password recovery email
- `updatePasswordRecovery` - Simulates updating password

### New Pages

#### 1. Email Verification Page (`/verify-email`)
Handles email verification links sent to users. The page:
- Extracts `userId` and `secret` from URL parameters
- Calls `updateEmailVerification` to verify the email
- Provides real-time feedback on verification status
- Redirects to the main app after successful verification

#### 2. Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`)
Allows users to request password recovery emails:
- Validates email format using existing validation utilities
- Calls `sendPasswordRecovery` to simulate recovery email sending
- Provides feedback on email sending status

#### 3. Reset Password Page (`/reset-password`)
Handles password reset links sent to users:
- Extracts `userId` and `secret` from URL parameters
- Provides form for entering new password with validation
- Calls `updatePasswordRecovery` to simulate setting new password
- Redirects to sign in page after successful reset

### Automatic Verification After Signup

The signup flow has been enhanced to work with the verification system:
- After successful account creation and sign in
- Users are notified about verification in the UI
- Actual email sending would be implemented when upgrading to a paid plan

### Form Validation

All new forms use the existing validation utilities:
- Email validation with regex pattern
- Password validation for strength requirements
- Real-time validation feedback as users type

## User Flow

### Email Verification Flow
1. User signs up with email and password
2. Verification email would be sent (simulated in free tier)
3. User clicks verification link in email
4. App opens `/verify-email` page with parameters
5. Email is verified and user is redirected to main app

### Password Recovery Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on sign in page
2. User enters email on `/forgot-password` page
3. Recovery email would be sent (simulated in free tier)
4. User clicks reset link in email
5. App opens `/reset-password` page with parameters
6. User enters new password and confirms
7. Password is updated and user is redirected to sign in

## Security Considerations

### Email Verification
- Verification links would be time-limited for security (simulated)
- Verification tokens would be single-use (simulated)
- User session is refreshed after successful verification

### Password Recovery
- Recovery links would be time-limited for security (simulated)
- Recovery tokens would be single-use (simulated)
- Password strength requirements enforced
- Session is invalidated after password reset

## Error Handling

### Verification Errors
- Invalid or expired verification links (simulated)
- Network errors during verification
- User not found errors

### Recovery Errors
- Invalid email addresses
- Expired recovery links (simulated)
- Weak password requirements not met
- Network errors during recovery

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Signup flow with verification simulation
2. Email verification with valid and invalid links
3. Forgot password flow with valid and invalid emails
4. Password reset with valid and invalid links
5. Password strength validation

### Edge Cases
- Multiple verification requests
- Multiple recovery requests
- Expired verification links (simulated)
- Expired recovery links (simulated)
- Concurrent sessions after password reset

## Future Improvements

### Full Implementation
When upgrading to a paid Appwrite plan, the methods can be updated to use the actual Appwrite functions:

```typescript
// Replace the hybrid implementation with actual Appwrite calls
const createEmailVerification = async (url: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await account.createVerification(url);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};

const updateEmailVerification = async (userId: string, secret: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await account.updateVerification(userId, secret);
    await checkAuthStatus();
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};

const sendPasswordRecovery = async (email: string, url: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await account.createRecovery(email, url);
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};

const updatePasswordRecovery = async (userId: string, secret: string, password: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await account.updateRecovery(userId, secret, password);
    await checkAuthStatus();
    return response;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Verification simulation not working as expected**
- Check that the deep links are properly configured
- Verify that the URL parameters are being passed correctly

**Issue: Recovery simulation not working as expected**
- Check that the deep links are properly configured
- Verify that the URL parameters are being passed correctly

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Appwrite connection
pnpm run test-appwrite

# View console logs for verification/recovery errors
# Check browser developer tools Network tab
```
