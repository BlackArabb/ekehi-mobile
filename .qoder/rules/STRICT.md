Do not remove or change functions, designs unles you have confirm , and you are sure that they are not implemented somewhere or they are nt needed.

A declared function that is not used anywhere in the code should not be removed, unles you are told to do so by the project manager. You should rather try to implement the function if you are sure that it integrate better with the code and fit the project.
